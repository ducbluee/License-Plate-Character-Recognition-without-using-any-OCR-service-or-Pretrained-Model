# License-Plate-Character-Recognition-without-using-any-OCR-service-or-Pretrained-Model
The project segments the characters on a typical license plate using image processing techniques and the opencv library. It then uses a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to perform license plate character recognition. The project neither uses any OCR service for character segmentation nor a pre-trained model like YOLO for recognition. Everything has been coded from scratch using basic scientific python library stack.
