# License-Plate-Character-Recognition-without-using-any-OCR-service-or-Pretrained-Model

The project segments the characters on a typical license plate using image processing techniques and the opencv library. It then uses a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to perform license plate character recognition. The project neither uses any OCR service for character segmentation nor a pre-trained model like YOLO for recognition. Everything has been coded from scratch using basic scientific python library stack.

## Getting Started

The project requires Anaconda distribution and is built using the scientific computing IDE known as Spyder. It uses basic image processing techniques to extract characters from the license plate. It then uses unsupervised learning for label generation. A popular clustering algorithm known as 'K-Means Clustering is implemented.' Finally, the project introduces a state-of-the-art CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture for classifying and recognizing the characters on a vehicle license plate.
